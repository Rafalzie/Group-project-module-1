  <li>Hi, we are Pris
    Let's shake this up
    
    We intend to improve the welfare of households in Iceland simply because it is possible . First and foremost, we intend to be the cheapest store for groceries and other daily household items. You may be wondering, how is that possible? No one has tried this in a dozen years and succeeded.
    
     
    
    But we're simply going to punk at all costs and rethink the shop completely. We intend to ensure the lowest possible price for you by digging and punking in purchase prices, processes, technology and equipment that save time and unnecessary costs.
    
    ​
    
    See you in Pris!</li>
  <li>a lot of fun</li>
  <li>unforgetable atmosphere</li>
</ul>
